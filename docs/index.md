# Introduction

The **Project 60 Membership Extension** aims to provide tools for a "European" interpretation of the "membership" concept. In the Anglo-Saxon countries (CiviCRM's native land) a membership is regarded as a service. If you don't pay anymore, you won't get the service - that's it. In a lot of other countries the conception is different: it's more like an indeterminate binding contract.

A number of problems arise from this slightly different interpretation:

- Membership fees are not necessarily entered manually, or collected via a payment processor, but can enter CiviCRM by other means (e.g. import, SEPA mandates, etc.).
- Memberships should be automatically extended, when the appropriate payment is in the system.
- You need to know who is behind on their payments and by how much.

The membership extension replaces the built-in functionality of extending memberships. It provides the following features:

- Assign contributions of a specific financial type to memberships. This makes it possible to find contacts that did not pay enough membership fees.
- Automatically extend the end date of a membership if enough membership fees for the period are paid.
- Create membership numbers automatically with a configurable pattern.
- Provide additional tokens for communication, for example cancellation date and reason.

The project 60 membership extension does not interfere with the built-in mechanism of membership types and membership statuses, as well as the  automatic changing of membership statuses.

## We need your support

This CiviCRM extension is provided as Free and Open Source Software, and we are happy if you find it useful. However, we have put a lot of work into it (and continue to do so), much of it unpaid for. So if you benefit from our software, please consider making a financial contribution so we can continue to maintain and develop it further.

If you are willing to support us in developing this CiviCRM extension, please send an email to info@systopia.de to get an invoice or agree a different payment method. Thank you!
